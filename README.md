HostsGenerator
==============

A PHP Web util designed to generate Hosts file


Features
------------
* Load domains from Hosts file, HTML source codes and your plain text files.
* Filter to avoid some lines like `127.0.0.1 localhost`
* Specify the address of some domains (to block ads?)
* Choose your DNS server
* TCP query
* IPv6 (AAAA) query
* Generate Hosts by posting data. (Really friendly to some cheap OpenWRT devices)
